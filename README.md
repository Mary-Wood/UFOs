# UFOs

## Overview of Project
This project created a webpage to present data that could be examined using multiple search functions. The project took data in JSON format and using Javascript analyzed and presented the data. 

## Results
The webpage presented the data unfiltered upon initial arrival to the page, then using multiple search criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape) would allow the user to further parse the results. 
To search the page, data could be entered in the search boxes on the left of the page. One or more criteria could be entered to fine tune the search results. 
Below are images of the search experience. The first image is the webpage upon first arrival. The second image is upon searching for the state "fl". The third image is using a second search criteria with "fl" for a specfic date, which yields no results.

## Summary
The one drawback of this design is that it can be hard to view all of the data. When the data is not filtered, it is a massive data file. I would recommend adding a limit to the number of entries and adding a page funtion to go through those results one page at a time. Additionally, for website to serve it's purpose, it should include more data points over more years.
